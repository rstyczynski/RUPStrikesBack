# Elaboration phase (3/4)

We are now in elaboration phase. Look into the "BACKLOG.md" document – focus on Sprints in status `Progress`.

Document the design. Create required diagrams, and class/data models to clarify requirement implementation. Once completed, wait for review and further instructions.

## Progress board

When the inception phase is started mark it by setting Sprint's status to `under_design` in the `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` file. Note it's allowed extension of general project rules.

Progress board is a table showing sprint, and backlog items state. It's the only purpose of this file. All potential comments, progress notes, etc. always keep in dedicated files for each phase.

When the inception if the Backlog Item belonging to the Sprint is started mark it by setting Backlog Item's status to `under_design` in the Sprint's chapter of the `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` file. Note it's allowed extension of general project rules.

When the analysis is completed - mark Backlog Item as `designed` in the Sprint's chapter `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` file. Note it's allowed extension of general project rules.
