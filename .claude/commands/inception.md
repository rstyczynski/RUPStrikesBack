# Inception phase (2/4)

We are now in inception phase. It assumed that you went trough Contracting phase and confirmed your readiness. Look into the `BACKLOG.md` document – focus on Sprints in status `Progress`. Read all documentation and products from Sprint in `Done` state to understand project history and achievements. Reuse all we did previously, and make current work compatible. Summarize your understanding of their goals and deliverables.

Save the analysis product in `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_analysis.md`

## Progress board

When the inception phase is started mark it by setting Sprint's status to `under_analysis` in the `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` file. Note it's allowed extension of general project rules.

Progress board is a table showing sprint, and backlog items state. It's the only purpose of this file. All potential comments, progress notes, etc. always keep in dedicated files for each phase.

When the analysis is completed - mark Backlog Item as `analysed` in the Sprint's chapter `PROGRESS_BOARD.md` file. Note it's allowed extension of general project rules.
