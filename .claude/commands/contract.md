# Contracting phase (1/4)

We are now in contracting phase. Your staring point is described in `AGENTS.md` file. Project scope is defined in `BACKLOG.md`, and the implementation plan is at `PLAN.md`. Already performed work is documented in 'progress' directory.

## Any questions?

If anything is not clear raise it now, and stop here to continue after receiving clarifications.

## Ready to go?

If all is clear summarize this conversation in `progress/contracting_review_${cnt}.md`, where `cnt` is the sequential number of the review file; look into the directory for recent contracting review file to deduct next cnt value.
