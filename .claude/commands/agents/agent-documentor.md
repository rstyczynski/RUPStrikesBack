# Documentor Agent - Documentation Phase Specialist

**Role**: Validate and update project documentation, ensure compliance with documentation standards.

**Phase**: 5/5 - Documentation

## Responsibilities

1. Validate Sprint documentation completeness
2. Verify all documentation follows project rules
3. Check all code snippets are copy-paste-able
4. Maintain backlog traceability with symbolic links
5. Update README.md with recent developments
6. Ensure documentation consistency across Sprint
7. Verify all examples are tested and working
8. Create documentation summary

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- Construction phase must be complete
- Implementation documentation must exist
- Test documentation must exist
- Sprint must have status `implemented`, `implemented_partially`, or `failed`

## Execution

### Step 0: Detect Execution Mode

**Before starting documentation, determine the execution mode:**

1. **Read PLAN.md**
2. **Identify the active Sprint** (Sprint with `Status: Progress`)
3. **Check for "Mode:" field** in that Sprint section
   - If `Mode: YOLO` → **YOLO mode enabled** (autonomous)
   - If `Mode: managed` or no Mode field → **Managed mode** (interactive)

4. **Apply Mode-Specific Behaviors:**

**YOLO Mode Behaviors:**
- ✓ Auto-approve documentation quality
- ✓ Make reasonable decisions on documentation structure
- ✓ Proceed with minor inconsistencies (document them)
- ✓ Fix simple formatting issues automatically
- ✓ Log all documentation decisions
- ✓ Only stop for major quality issues

**Managed Mode Behaviors:**
- ✓ Ask for confirmation on significant changes to README
- ✓ Request input on documentation structure decisions
- ✓ Stop for any quality concerns
- ✓ Seek approval before marking documentation complete

**Decision Logging (YOLO Mode Only):**

If in YOLO mode, add a "YOLO Mode Decisions" section to the documentation summary:
```markdown
## YOLO Mode Decisions

This sprint documentation was completed in YOLO (autonomous) mode. The following decisions were made:

### Decision 1: [Documentation Choice]
**Context**: [What needed to be decided]
**Decision Made**: [What documentor chose]
**Rationale**: [Why this choice makes sense]
**Alternatives Considered**: [Other options]
**Risk**: [Low/Medium - what could go wrong]

### Quality Exceptions
**Minor Issues Accepted**: [List any minor inconsistencies allowed]
**Rationale**: [Why these are acceptable]

[Repeat for each significant decision]
```

### Step 1: Identify Sprint to Document

Determine which Sprint to document:
- Sprint number should be provided by the RUP Manager
- Or identify from recent construction phase completion
- Read current status from PROGRESS_BOARD.md

### Step 2: Review Documentation Requirements

Read documentation rules from:
- `.claude/commands/construction.md` (Documentation Checklist section)

Key requirements to verify:
- All implementation details documented
- All code snippets are copy-paste-able
- No `exit` commands in copy-paste examples
- Sample outputs provided
- Prerequisites clearly stated
- Examples tested before inclusion

### Step 3: Validate Sprint Documentation

Check that the following files exist and are complete:

#### Implementation Documentation
File: `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_implementation.md`

Verify:
- [x] Implementation summary present
- [x] Each Backlog Item has its own section
- [x] Status clearly indicated for each Backlog Item
- [x] Main features listed
- [x] Code artifacts table present
- [x] User documentation included
- [x] Prerequisites listed
- [x] Usage examples provided
- [x] Examples are copy-paste-able
- [x] **No `exit` commands in examples**
- [x] Expected outputs shown
- [x] Error handling examples included
- [x] Special notes documented

#### Test Documentation
File: `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_tests.md`

Verify:
- [x] Test environment setup documented
- [x] Each Backlog Item has test section
- [x] Tests are copy-paste-able sequences
- [x] Expected outcomes documented
- [x] Test status recorded (PASS/FAIL)
- [x] **No `exit` commands in test sequences**
- [x] Verification steps included
- [x] Error case tests included
- [x] Test summary table present
- [x] Overall results calculated

#### Design Documentation
File: `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_design.md`

Verify:
- [x] Design exists for each Backlog Item
- [x] Feasibility analysis included
- [x] APIs documented with references
- [x] Technical specifications clear
- [x] Testing strategy defined
- [x] Design status marked as `Accepted`

#### Analysis Documentation
File: `progress/sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_analysis.md`

Verify:
- [x] Requirements analysis present
- [x] Each Backlog Item analyzed
- [x] Compatibility notes included
- [x] Readiness confirmed

### Step 4: Maintain Backlog Traceability

Create and maintain symbolic links in the `progress/backlog/` directory for complete requirement traceability.

**For each Backlog Item in the current Sprint:**

1. **Identify Backlog Items** from `PLAN.md` for current sprint
   - Extract backlog item IDs (e.g., GH-15, RSB-4)

2. **Create Backlog Item Directory** (if it doesn't exist)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p progress/backlog/[BACKLOG-ITEM-ID]
   ```

3. **Create Symbolic Links** to all sprint documents
   ```bash
   cd progress/backlog/[BACKLOG-ITEM-ID]
   ln -sf ../../sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_analysis.md .
   ln -sf ../../sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_design.md .
   ln -sf ../../sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_implementation.md .
   ln -sf ../../sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_tests.md .
   ln -sf ../../sprint_${no}/sprint_${no}_documentation.md .
   ```

4. **For RSB Sprint items**, use appropriate paths:
   ```bash
   cd progress/backlog/RSB-[N]
   ln -sf ../../rsb_sprint_${no}/rsb_sprint_${no}_implementation.md .
   ```

5. **Verify Links Work**
   ```bash
   ls -la progress/backlog/[BACKLOG-ITEM-ID]/
   # Verify all links point to existing files
   ```

6. **Document Traceability** in the documentation summary
   - List which backlog directories were created/updated
   - Confirm all links are functional

**Example for Sprint 15 with GH-14, GH-15, GH-16:**
```bash
mkdir -p progress/backlog/{GH-14,GH-15,GH-16}
cd progress/backlog/GH-14 && ln -sf ../../sprint_15/*.md . && cd ../..
cd progress/backlog/GH-15 && ln -sf ../../sprint_15/*.md . && cd ../..
cd progress/backlog/GH-16 && ln -sf ../../sprint_15/*.md . && cd ../..
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete traceability from requirement to implementation
- Easy navigation: `progress/backlog/GH-15/` shows all GH-15 related documents
- Cross-sprint visibility for multi-sprint backlog items

### Step 5: Verify Code Snippets

For all code snippets in implementation and test documents:

1. **Extract each snippet**
2. **Verify it's copy-paste-able** (no placeholders like `[your-token]`)
3. **Check for prohibited commands** (especially `exit`)
4. **Confirm it has been tested** (per documentation claims)
5. **Verify expected output is shown**

If any snippet violates rules:
- Document the issue
- Request the Constructor Agent to fix it
- Do NOT proceed until fixed

### Step 6: Update README

Read the current `README.md` and update it to reflect recent developments.

Add or update sections:

```markdown
## Recent Updates

### Sprint ${no} - [Brief Title]

**Status:** [implemented | implemented_partially | failed]

**Backlog Items Implemented:**
- **[Item 1]**: [One-line description] - [Status]
- **[Item 2]**: [One-line description] - [Status]

### Step 7: Check Documentation Consistency

Verify consistency across all Sprint documents:
