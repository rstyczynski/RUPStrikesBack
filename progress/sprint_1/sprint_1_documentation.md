   - Maintain progress/backlog/ structure for easy navigation

3. **Update README Consistently**
   - Add each sprint to "Recent Updates" section
   - Keep project status current
   - Update version information

4. **Preserve Testing Rigor**
   - Maintain 100% test coverage standard
   - Document both success and error cases
   - Include verification steps

### For Sprint 2 (CLI Development)

1. Use Sprint 1 as template for documentation structure
2. Link CLI implementation back to Open-Meteo integration documented here
3. Reference Go setup from README.md
4. Build on testing patterns established in Sprint 1

## Summary

Sprint 1 documentation is comprehensive, well-structured, and fully compliant with all project standards. The complete RUP cycle was executed with high quality across all five phases:

1. **Contracting** - ACS established and confirmed
2. **Inception** - Requirements analyzed and approved
3. **Elaboration** - Design created and accepted
4. **Construction** - Implementation delivered and tested (100% pass rate)
5. **Documentation** - All artifacts validated and traceable

The deliverables (README.md + weather API docs) provide excellent foundation for Sprint 2 CLI development.

**Recommendation:** ✅ Sprint 1 ready for final review and closure.
